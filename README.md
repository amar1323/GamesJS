This repository is created so I can save my progress following

To be learned:
=============
I would like to understand more JavaScript, game developpement techniques and finally how to deploy web projects

Used techno:
=======
Vanilla JavaScript

Done:
=====
1. spriteAnimation : in this project, we take a 2D image containing different states of a dog character, then we create different animation.
2. parallaxbackgrouds : how to make a 2D background move in an infinit loop, each layer at a different speed
3. Enemy mouvement : understant how to make random or sin/cos mouvement (I can do more complexe but Im intrested only in the core concepts)
4. Fadding away colision animation : using same princple as sprite animation. In addition to adding sound and making stuff rotate
5. Point and click game: color collision technique+ particle animation+ animation of boom at hit
6. Factorise the code using POO (inheritence). I still need to study more JavaScript, POO rules are very different from c++ (super, extends, members of child accessible in parent ...)
7. Side scroller game: combining all projects, sprite animation, paralax background, enemy variaty, collision and also adding key event handling.
